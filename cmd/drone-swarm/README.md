# Drone Swarm Simulation

**Status: Planned (Not Yet Implemented)**

This simulation will demonstrate coordinated drone swarm operations using the Legion C2 platform.

## Planned Features

- Multi-drone coordination and formation flying
- Real-time telemetry and position updates
- Swarm behavior patterns (formation, dispersion, convergence)
- Task distribution among swarm members
- Collision avoidance algorithms
- Command and control of individual and group behaviors

## Future Implementation

This simulation is planned for future development. When implemented, it will showcase Legion's capabilities for managing multiple autonomous entities in coordinated operations.
